allegro-mapping
Random files I used to learn a bit more about Allegro's image manipulation techniques

Future plans for the repo:
alm_bin.c - making binary files that represent game maps, and loading them into alm
alm_plr.c - adding a player with proper collision
alm_chn.c - adding a chunk system for larger maps so there's less to render
